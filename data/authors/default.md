I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about Backend and DevOps. I spend time creating/experimenting on systems using strategies and their throughput. In free time I play CTFs and Competitive Programming Challenges with my friends.

Besides programming, I also enjoy playing video games(especially Minecraft), listening to heavy & melodic music(mostly Eminem), watching netflix and gymming ðŸ˜Š.
