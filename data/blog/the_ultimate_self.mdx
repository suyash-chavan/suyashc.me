# Introduction
It's been 21 years of life for me, around one-third of my lifetime and as a reasearch 
person I have always experiment and there are very fundamental observations that I would like 
to talk about. Topic name has a lot of weight in it itself but fundamentals may not feel 
taht weighted but trust me they are worth discussing and trying to tweak them according 
to us to create our ultimate self.

# Decision
Every act we performe is directly associalted to a decision of doing it. And this decision making
is crucial part of everything we do voluntary or involuntary.

## Psychological View
Psychology in itself is huge forest to explore, but let's stick some of its points that I think 
are valid but there may be more and as well as contrast points. Most fundamental thing tht human
does in realistic world is action. It is just an act of doing something that influences realistic
matter. And this act can be anything like walking, eating, talking and what so ever. And before 
acting we take a discision to act. And according to Psychology this decision is governed by 
every single thing that we can think of. Right from our existance i.e DNA, harmones, bloodline,
history whatever you say influences bahivior of organism. Equally important is environment in 
which individual has evolved till the moment aggergating every single experience and thought.

## Neural Network Analogy
Descision making is classification problem and this classification depends on factors discussed 
above. DNA or blood line gives us initial weights and are eventually adjusted by our experiences, 
thoughts and environment. 

# Mental State
Every act we take can be associated to a mental state at that moment. 

## Enjoyment
If you enjoy a act it is said to be done in state of enjoyment. This doesn't mean that every enjoyable
act is good. Addictions are enjoyable. Scientifically every act that makes us secrete Dopamine is
enjoyable. There are also levels of enjoyment according to Dopamine secretion.

### Exitement vs Curious vs Interest
We are talking about absolute feeling here and no words because Curious or event interest can be exitement to 
someone and highly depends on word used by individual.

## Discipline
Discipline is ultimate change and usually goes against enjoyment, against dopamine hit and it is the
real control. It is hard to be disciplined and hardness may vary individually.
